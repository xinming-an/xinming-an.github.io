I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Anesthesiology]((https://www.med.unc.edu/anesthesiology/directory/xinming-simon-an/)) 
and [Institute for Trauma Recovery](https://www.med.unc.edu/itr/) at UNC-Chapel Hill. 
I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in the development 
and application of advanced statistical techniques for health research based on 
complex multimodal data, such as self-report survey, genomic, imaging and mobile device data. 

I serve as co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core for several large 
scale research studies conducted at UNC-Chapel Hill, including prominent projects 
like AURORA and DISENTANGLE. Throughout my career, I have taken a lead role in 
numerous research initiatives, where I've been responsible for developing risk 
prediction tools, investigating homogeneous subgroups, and identifying objective biomarkers

I obtained my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology and M.S. in Statistics at UCLA, 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Peter Bentler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=esb4VbgAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Before joining UNC, I worked at SAS for many years where I developed the IRT procedure 
and contributed to many other procedures in the SAS/STAT software.
