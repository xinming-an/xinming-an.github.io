I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in developing and 
applying advanced statistical and computational models to address complex healthcare 
research challenges. Through close collaborations 
with clinicians, one major focus of my research is to advance patient-centered, 
evidence-based, and integrative perioperative patient care by identifying and testing 
risk factor, evaluated treatment effect of individual and combined treatments and developing 
risk prediction tools. Another key area of my research centers on posttraumatic outcomes, 
with particular emphasis on chronic posttraumatic pain, where I have led efforts to develop 
risk prediction tools, identify homogeneous subgroups, and discover objective biomarkers. 
At UNC-Chapel Hill, I serve as a co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core for 
several large-scale trauma studies. Through my collaboration with researchers from multiple 
disciplines, I have gained firsthand experience on the importance of multidisciplinary 
teamwork in advancing research and patient care, particularly in the application of 
artificial intelligence (AI). Drawing on my diverse research experience and background 
across many different fields, my overarching goal is to build and lead interdisciplinary 
teams that integrate clinical domain knowledge, advanced analytics, and AI to advance 
healthcare research and practice.
