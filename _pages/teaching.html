As a statistician, teaching is not limited to formal fashions. When collaborating with applied researchers, we need to explain statistical concepts and interpret results using plain language rather than equations. I always try to make statistical concepts easier to understand by taking advantage of many teaching strategies. My teaching philosophy acknowledges that the objective of statistical class is not only to help students acquire statistical modeling, programming, and communication skills, but also to help them avoid abusing analytic techniques, making overstate conclusions, and being misled by others. I also strongly believe that the same statistical topics should be taught differently to different audiences based on their interests. For example, for Ph.D. students interested in developing new statistical techniques, teaching should focus more on the mathematical and technical details. On the other hand, for master students interested in using statistical models to address different research questions, teaching should focus on hands-on analytic, communication, and project management skills. Finally, for researchers interested in knowing the most useful/appropriate model to address different types of research aims, teaching should focus more on a high-level overview and the interpretation of results from the different modeling techniques. 


Since joining UNC around 2018, I have spent a substantial portion of my time and efforts in providing individual mentorship. I am the primary mentor to biostatisticians on all the research projects where I was/am a co-investigator. I have co-mentored several Ph.D. students on their dissertations. Mentees have garnered two student paper awards at top statistical meetings. During these mentorships, I help them build hands-on statistical analysis and programming skills by working on real projects. Because of the collaborative teamwork nature of biostatistics, I strongly believe that personal skills, such as communication and presentation, are as important as technical skills for biostatisticians. To this end, I will often emphasize the importance of these personal skills with examples and create opportunities for them to develop these skills. 
	
	
	
I have also provided guidance to many individuals on preparing conference abstracts and posters where I help them learn how to interpret results from various statistical models. From 2021-2023, I also provided a short course to a group of minority medical students (Castillo Scholars program) at UNC where I taught them different types of study aims and the corresponding statistical methods to address these aims.
