I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in the development and application of advanced statistical techniques for health research. My background encompasses training and research in mathematics, statistics, and psychometrics, providing a solid foundation in various statistical modeling techniques and their practical applications in health-related research projects. 



Research
======

My research has a strong focus on complex and high-dimensional data analysis, with a particular emphasis on its relevance to medical research, especially in the context of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) and perioperative outcomes. I serve as a co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core for several large scale research studies conducted at UNC-Chapel Hill, including prominent projects like AURORA and DISENTANGLE. Throughout my career, I have taken a lead role in numerous research initiatives, where I've been responsible for developing risk prediction tools, investigating homogeneous subgroups, and identifying objective biomarkers related to APNS.
