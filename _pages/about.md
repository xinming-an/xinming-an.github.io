This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About Me
======
I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in the development and application of advanced statistical models for health research. My background encompasses training and research in mathematics, statistics, and psychometrics, providing a solid foundation in various statistical modeling techniques and their practical applications in health-related projects. My research has a strong focus on the analysis of complex, high-dimensional data, with a particular emphasis on its relevance to medical research, especially in the context of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). I serve as a co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core for several research studies conducted at UNC-Chapel Hill, including prominent projects like AURORA and DISENTANGLE. Throughout my career, I have taken a lead role in numerous research initiatives, where I've been responsible for developing risk prediction tools, investigating homogeneous subgroups, and identifying objective biomarkers related to APNS.
