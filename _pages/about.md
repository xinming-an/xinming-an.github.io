I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Institute for Trauma Recovery at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in the development and application of advanced statistical techniques for health research. My background encompasses training and research in mathematics, statistics, and psychometrics, providing a solid foundation in various statistical modeling techniques and their practical applications in health-related research projects. 

I serve as co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core for several large scale research studies conducted at UNC-Chapel Hill, including prominent projects like AURORA and DISENTANGLE. Throughout my career, I have taken a lead role in numerous research initiatives, where I've been responsible for developing risk prediction tools, investigating homogeneous subgroups, and identifying objective biomarkers

I obtained my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology and M.S. in Statistics at UCLA, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Peter Bentler. Before joining UNC, I worked at SAS for many years where I developed the IRT procedure and contributed to many other procedures in the SAS/STAT software.
