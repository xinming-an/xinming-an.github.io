I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Anesthesiology]((https://www.med.unc.edu/anesthesiology/directory/xinming-simon-an/)) 
and [Institute for Trauma Recovery](https://www.med.unc.edu/itr/) at UNC-Chapel Hill. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology and M.S. in Statistics at UCLA, 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Peter Bentler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=esb4VbgAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Before joining UNC, I worked at SAS for many years where I developed the IRT procedure 
and contributed to many other procedures in the SAS/STAT software. 

I am an interdisciplinary researcher with extensive experience in developing and applying 
advanced statistical and computational models to address complex healthcare research 
challenges. My training in mathematics, statistics, and psychometrics provides a 
strong foundation for a multidisciplinary research project. Through close collaborations 
with clinicians, one major focus of my research is to advance patient-centered, 
evidence-based, and integrative perioperative patient care by identifying and testing 
risk factor, evaluated treatment effect of individual and combined treatments and developing 
risk prediction tools. Another key area of my research centers on posttraumatic outcomes, 
with particular emphasis on chronic posttraumatic pain, where I have led efforts to develop 
risk prediction tools, identify homogeneous subgroups, and discover objective biomarkers. 
At UNC-Chapel Hill, I serve as a co-Investigator and lead the statistical analysis core 
for several large-scale trauma studies. Through my collaboration with researchers from 
multiple disciplines, I have gained firsthand experience on the importance of multidisciplinary 
teamwork in advancing research and patient care, particularly in the application of 
artificial intelligence (AI). Drawing on my diverse research experience and 
background across many different fields, my overarching goal is to build and lead 
interdisciplinary teams that integrate clinical domain knowledge, advanced analytics, 
and AI to advance healthcare research and practice.
